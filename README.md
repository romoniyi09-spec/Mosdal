## Supabase setup (required — do this first)

This app now stores everything (portfolio, testimonials, quote requests,
orders, and the admin login) in a real Supabase database instead of the
browser's localStorage. Nothing will load or save until you connect a
Supabase project:

1. **Create a project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (the free
   tier is enough).
2. **Run the schema.** Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → paste the full
   contents of [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) → Run. This
   creates the four tables, locks them down
    with Row Level Security, sets
   up the public `portfolio-images` storage bucket, and seeds the site with
   the original demo portfolio/testimonial content.
3. **Create the admin account.** Dashboard → Authentication → Users → Add
   user → enter an email (e.g. `admin@mosdal.com`) and a password. This
   replaces the old hardcoded `mosdal2026` password — only this account can
   sign into `/admin`.
4. **Copy your API keys.** Dashboard → Project Settings → API → copy the
   "Project URL" and the `anon` "public" key.
5. **Set your environment variables.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and
   fill in:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@mosdal.com   # the email you used in step 3
   ```
6. `npm install` (Supabase's client library is already in `package.json`),
   then `npm run dev`.

The admin login screen still only asks for a password — `VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL`
tells Supabase which account that password belongs to. Every portfolio
add/edit/delete, quote request, order, and testimonial approval now goes
through Supabase's database with Row Level Security, so:
- Site visitors can submit quotes, orders, and testimonials, and can read
  the public portfolio and approved reviews.
- Only someone signed in as the admin can see quote/order details, approve
  or reject testimonials, and add/edit/remove portfolio items (including
  uploading images, which now go to Supabase Storage instead of being
  base64-encoded into localStorage).
